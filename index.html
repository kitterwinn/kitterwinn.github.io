<p> Hi there! My name is Kaitlyn Cross. I am a Senior VCD student at Eastern Washington University. When I am not at school learning how to code and build websites, I am "adulting" at two different jobs. I hop around between being a Pizza Hut Waitress, and a Natural Foods Associate at Yokes Fresh Market. I love puppies and hiking and the Fall.</p>

    <p>This book just happens to be my favorite right now because I am going through a poetry phase and this one makes me feel feelings.</p>
